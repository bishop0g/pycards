# PyCards
Ongoing coding project started in college, representing playing cards as Python objects. 

This project aims to go deeper than other tutorials: instead of just instantizing cards, this project incorporates attributes (such as the Face Up/Down concept) that are relevant to demonstrating programming logic within various card games. The idea is that games can be played within the terminal by using notation similar to chess pieces (KH = King of Hearts, 2S = Two of Spades, etc.) and specifying a Target Card and a Destination Card, Pile, or Hand.
